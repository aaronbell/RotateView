# Rotate View
[Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/) plugin that allows one to rotate a glyph and view it from different angles. This plugin was inspired by an experience in punchcutting and appreciating the ability to rotate a Glyph and look at curves from all angles. 

Code is written by Aaron Bell

# Usage

* Open the *Rotate View* plugin from the *Window* menu. 
* It will automatically display the currently selected glyph. 
* Use the slider to rotate the glyph in the view clockwise and counter-clockwise.
* The window can be resized and the glyph will resize. 

# Installation

Install by clicking its *Install* button in *Window > Plugin Manager > Plugins* (Glyphs 3) or *Window > Plugin Manager* (Glyphs 2). Restart Glyphs once.

üëâ Rotate View depends on the *Vanilla* module. Please install it via *Window > Plugin Manager > Modules* (Glyphs 3) or *Glyphs > Preferences > Addons > Modules* (Glyphs 2).

# Requirements

Tested on Glyphs 2.4.1 under OSX El Capitan. The script may not work under an older version of Glyphs or OS.
