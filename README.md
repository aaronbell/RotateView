# RotateView
[Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/) plugin that allows one to rotate a glyph and view it from different angles. This plugin was inspired by an experience in punchcutting and appreciating the ability to rotate a Glyph and look at curves from all angles. 

Code is written by Aaron Bell

#Usage

Open the RotateView plugin from the Window menu. 
It will automatically display the currently selected glyph. 
Use the slider to rotate the glyph in the view clockwise and counter-clockwise.
The window can be resized and the glyph will resize. 

üëâDepends on Vanilla module. Please install it via Glyphs Preferences > Addons > Module

#Requirements

Tested on Glyphs 2.4.1 under OSX El Capitan. The script may not work under an older version of Glyphs or OS.
